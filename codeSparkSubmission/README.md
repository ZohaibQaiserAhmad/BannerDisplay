# codeSpark Sample Banner App

This app was created using create-react-app for the front-end and Mirage JS for mocking out the API.

To run this app, you will need to install the dependencies, then start the app using either `npm start` or `yarn start`.

All source files are located in the /src folder. Front-end component files are located within that folder under /components. The structure for the API is located inside the `server.js` file. 

## Scenario
The purpose of this app is to display a collection of banner objects and allow a user to add, update, or delete from that collection. How you choose to do that is up to you. The setup for the mock data and the API is in `server.js`. The setup for the client is in /components/App.js.

App is able to do the following tasks:
  <ul>
  <li>fetch and display all the banner objects</li>
  <li>ability to add a new banner object</li>
  <li>ability to edit an existing banner object</li>
  <li>ability to remove an existing banner object</li>
  </ul>


An example of what can be done might look something like this:
